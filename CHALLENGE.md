# Interact with APIs
## Aire Logic Tech Test

**Produce a program which, when given the name of an artist, will produce the average
(mean) number of words in their songs.**<br />
This should be a CLI application that is usable from the command line.
What you will be evaluated on<br />
- How you get, parse, and aggregate the data.
- How your program is structured
- The interface your program provides
### Submission
Please submit a git repository with source code either in a zip file or hosted on GitHub or
a similar service, and email the link to your contact at AireLogic. Please do not include
executables or libraries in the zip or repository.
Please make sure to include:
- A README including instructions on how to run the project
- A list of dependencies or a file specifying them
If we cannot run the project then we wonâ€™t be able to review this test.
### Pointers
There are two APIs that will help you to get this working (you may use other data sources to
complete this task if you wish):
